**Principles**
- We are responsive and answer any questions and communications within 24 hours.
- We are proactive and complete assignments in advance when possible.
- We are open and transparent when communicating. All ideas and views are treated equally.
- We use Github Projects to manage our backlog, and work on it when possible.
- Backlog should be updated regularly based on discussion during weekly meetings.
- All work items are as small and as granular as possible.
- All changes are developed in a separate git branch.
- After the change is complete, make a pull request and link the issue. Make sure the pull request aligns with the specified definition of done.
- Be open and communicative about any progress made, if there are any delays, make sure to notify team members.
- Don’t be afraid to ask for assistance
- Members need to check that all major functional merges work as expected, even if they pass the pull request.
- All changes to the code should be thoroughly documented once complete.

**Process**
- Team Meetings and Planning(1/week)
- Demo/Review with TA(1/week)
- Meeting with Project Partner(~1/ 4 weeks)
- Merge Meeting(1/ 2 weeks)

**Definition of Done (DoD)**
- Functionality is complete
- Functionality passes test at an acceptable level
- Changes are merged to the main branch and tested against existing features
- No regressions, entire project functions to spec
- Documentation is updated
- Changes are noted and demoed for next stakeholder meeting
- Backlog updated

**Release Cycle**
- Update every successful pull request
- Automatically deploy to staging for every merge to main branch
- Deploy to production every release
- Release every three months
- Use semantic versioning MAJOR.minor.patch
  - Increment the minor version for new features
  - Increment the patch version for bug fixes
  - Increment the major version for breaking API changes
